# Decampus: Share the Knowledge, Share the Books
Tired of overpriced textbooks holding you back? Decampus is your new campus lifeline, connecting bookworms like you with a platform to share, borrow, and discover knowledge, all while saving some serious cash and building a vibrant community.

## **Here's what you can do with Decampus:**

- Browse a curated feed of available books on your campus. Find that elusive textbook or uncover hidden gems you never knew existed (and never knew you needed).
- üîó Connect with fellow students and swap books with ease. Build a network of book-loving friends and make learning more collaborative.
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Turn dusty shelves into opportunities for others, declutter your space, and earn some extra $$$. List your books and give them a second life, without the hassle of writing a whole bunch of descriptions. Just take a picture and let the magic happen `(shotout to Gemini API and Vertex AI)` . 
- üîç Search for specific books by title, author, or course. Zero in on exactly what you need and ditch the endless library aisle wanderings.

Join a thriving community of bookworms. Share recommendations, discuss topics, and build a sense of belonging on campus.
Decampus is more than just a book exchange, it's a social revolution. We're making learning accessible, sustainable, and downright fun. Join us and unlock the power of shared knowledge!
